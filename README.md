# Filtro Cursos Pucp
This is a useful tool made with Javascript with the intention of filtering and showing all the possible combinations of courses based on the selection of the teachers that you want. This can help students as this tool can show graphically all the schedules based in multiple selection, rather than the basic schedule generator of the PUCP website. 

# Requisites
There are not mandatory requisites but we recomend:
+ Node.js (Any version)

# How to run the tool
Go to the directory where the scheduleGenerator.js is located

Execute:
node scheduleGenerator.js
